Shuffle Buddy Functionality:
- Create an account and log in to use Shuffle Buddy.
- Sign in as admin to make changes to users, security questions, and the default playlist.
- Users can reset their password using their security question.
- Logging in will take the user to the home page.
- Navigate to playlist creation, deletion, and playlist page from the home page.
- Add and remove playlists from your account in the add/remove pages.
- Selecting a playlist displays all the songs in a playlist, and allows for listening and editing.
- Add and delete songs from your playlist in the playlist editor.
- Start a session by listening to the playlist.
- Play, pause, or skip songs during a session.
- Songs will be shuffled depending on what you have listened to, and what you currently prefer.
- For example, if you are only listening to the calm songs in your playlist, energetic songs
  will be shuffled to the back of the playlist.
